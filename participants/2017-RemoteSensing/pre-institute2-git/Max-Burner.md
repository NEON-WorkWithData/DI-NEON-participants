*By Maxwell Burner*
I have a B.S. and an M.S. in Environmental Science. I got my M.S. in Richland, living across the street
from Battelle and the US Government's Pacific Northwest National Lab institute. I would love to go back
and work there someday. This is a great opportunity for me because it combines my interest in evironmental 
science with my interest in data science

As far as project ideas: I know we have tutorials for both R and Python, but what about Scala? It's not as
common, and I'm not as skilled in it as R or Python, but it is used a lot for distributed computation.
