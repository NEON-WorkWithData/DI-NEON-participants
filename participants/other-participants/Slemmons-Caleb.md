Senior Field Ecologist Domain 5 (Great Lakes)
***
I work in NEONs Field Science group at our office in Northern Wisconsin. The Field Science team is responsible for the field operations of the Observatory. My background is mostly in plant ecology but I currently work as an instrumentation technician focusing on Terrestrial Instrument Systems. We maintain, troubleshoot and monitor the systems to produce high quality data for the Network and researchers.

Goal: To expand knowledge of using R and begin to develop scripts that can be used to analyze NEON instrument systems data products. Learn about hosting NEON data workshops

##Possible capstone:## Develop scripts to calculate mean seasonal wind directions at multiple levels of our flux towers. This should help inform if tower booms are pointed to minimize disturbance of windflow from the tower structure.
