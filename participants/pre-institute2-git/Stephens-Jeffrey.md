# **Bio**
Hi, I am Jeffrey Stephens and I am pursuing a PhD in Geospatial Science and Engineering at South Dakota State University where I am focusing on remote sensing and natural resources. Currently, I am using MODIS and Landsat imagery to study phenology and primary production to further understand ecological processes. In my free time when I am not studying I typically like to spend it outdoors.
##  **Course Goal**
My course goal is to learn how to use hyperspectral imagery and waveform lidar to characterize vegetation. 
### _**Capstone Project**_
I would like to use the NEONâ€™s flux tower measurements and remotely sensed data to link the near on the ground phenology measurements to satellites measurements of phenology at different scales. Typically local measurements of phenology in remotely sensed studies such as those that use MODIS imagery to study phenology over vast areas lack phenological measurements at multiple scales. By using the flux tower phenological measurements along with other data such as topography, PAR, C02, and weather measurements e.g. temperature and precipitation. I hope to better understand freeze-thaw cycles, the start of the growing season, peak of season, end of growing season and to identify spatial and temporal variations in phenology at different scales to understand climate change.
