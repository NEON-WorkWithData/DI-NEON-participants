I am currently a summer intern at NEON working with the AOP Product Team and a Biology student at the University of Puerto Rico Río Piedras Campus. I find anything related to Ecology and Remote Sensing (including everything in between) absolutely fascinating. Something I greatly enjoy is learning Mandarin Chinese. I can understand around 15% of street conversations at the moment :joy:. Outdoor activities, eating fancy-healthy food, watching documentaries, window-shopping at bookstores, and meeting new people are other ventures I like. Additionally, I really like

### Internship Project
I am developing a plugin for the open-source geographic information system QGIS that reads and properly displays NEON hyperspectral data. My project is located at the meeting interface between:
- Python
- QGIS
- HDF5

### Goals
- To gain experience in data science, computer science, programming, and remote sensing
- To learn from peers and mentors in the fields mentioned above (**this is the goal for the course**)
