## Kelly Meehan

Hi, I am a Remote Sensing Analyst for Reclamation. I create landcover classifications for agricultural lands that have water rights for the Colorado River. These classifications are used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (as a proxy for consumptive use).

My goals for the Data Institute include exploring using LiDAR to improve the accuracy of classifications, as well as using python workflows for object-based image analysis. My hope is to utilize the skills learned in this class for a vegetation mapping project which will be used to identify potential survey and conservation project areas.

## Domain of Interest

Desert Southwest

## Proposed Capstone Project

For the capstone project, I am seeking to use NEON AOP data (potentially along with WorldView data), for a change detection analysis (preferably of a riparian area).
